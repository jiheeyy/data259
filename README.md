# data259

This repo contains all code related to DSP or IP in UChicago DATA 259

IP folder contains code (preprocessing_omi.ipynb, ethics_IP.ipynb)
and relevant datasets, excluding the fer2013 dataset due to upload size limits.
I also couldn't upload tensorflow model weights due to upload size limits.
* Edit after reading on Ed that I must upload all relevant materials: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tFEuTvSn7h-ixtoxYiyUEpbAskcIB3Eq?usp=sharing (has fer2013 zipped and three model weights)
